AnimalKingdom

Final Project edX Microsoft: DEV277x Object Oriented Programming in Java

Every object in this world is a "critter", where Critter is the super class with default behavior defined. You will be writing five classes, each representing a different type of Animal: Bear, Tiger, WhiteTiger, Giant and NinjaCat. All of the classes you right should be sub classes of Critter. On each round of the simulation, each critter is asked for 3 pieces of information:

How should it act?
What color is it?
What string represents that critter?

These 3 pieces of information are provided by 3 methods present in each Critter class. 

public Action getMove(CritterInfo info) { ... }

public Color getColor() { ... }

public String toString() { ... }
